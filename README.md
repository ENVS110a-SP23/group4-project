Projects to promote natural life in urban areas and utilize 
locally-sourced food have grown increasingly popular. One prominent 
example of this is the increase in urban farms. Urban farms are commercial 
agricultural operations within cities. In addition to introducing greenery 
to the cities and allegedly improving air quality, they also provide a 
source of locally-sourced food. In 2013 Boston passed Article 89 to 
provide “ residents better access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food.”  
Today there are more than 10 commercial urban farms in Boston and more 
than 14 regions within the city have at least one notable garden.
However, farming can affect watersheds. Successful farming requires 
fertilizers, but these fertilizers make the soil more nutrient-dense. 
Stormwater runoff can carry nutrients away from the farm and into streams, 
rivers, and lakes. The EPA estimates that 58% of rivers and streams in the 
United States are high in nutrients. When waterways are too 
nutrient-dense, algal blooms occur and deplete oxygen levels and block 
sunlight. Without adequate oxygen and sunlight, other forms of aquatic 
life, such as fish, suffer. This process is called eutrophication. 
Nitrogen and phosphorous are the primary nutrients that contribute to 
eutrophication. In Mississippi, researchers found that runoff from urban 
gardens contained 2-3x as much dissolved nitrogen and 100x as much 
dissolved phosphorus as average urban runoff. However, that same study 
found that the amount of runoff from urban gardens was less than in areas 
without green space. In seas of cement, urban farms and gardens are 
sponges of porous soil that retain stormwater. The sponge effect of soil 
works in opposition to the increased nutrient densities of farming. We are 
interested in the effect of urban farming in the Boston area. Keeping in 
mind the two mentioned effects, we ask, do urban farms contribute to 
higher nutrient densities in Boston waterways?
We plan to look at urban farms in the Boston area. Our primary dataset 
will utilize the Water Quality laboratory data (2005-2020), a large 
dataset of water quality sample data including nutrients and other 
parameters collected at various monitoring stations throughout 
Massachusetts, from mass.gov. We’ll also be using information from 
GrowBoston to compile our own dataset on urban farm locations and other 
relevant information. The water quality dataset is quite large, with 78490 
samples recorded. Though we’ll be going through and refining the data to 
only include samples relevant to urban farm locations in the Boston area, 
there should still be a significant number of samples to work with. We 
will identify and pair sensors close to urban farms in Boston and compare 
their data with the data of sensors further away.
