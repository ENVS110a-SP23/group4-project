Projects to promote natural life in urban areas and utilize locally-sourced food have grown increasingly popular. One prominent example of this is the increase in urban farms. Urban farms are commercial agricultural operations within cities. In addition to introducing greenery to the cities and allegedly improving air quality, they also provide a source of locally-sourced food. In 2013 Boston passed Article 89 to provide 'residents better access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food.'  Today there are more than 10 commercial Urban Farms in Boston and more than 14 regions within the city have at least one notable garden.
However, farming can affect watersheds. Successful farming requires fertilizers. These fertilizers make the soil more nutrient dense. Stormwater runoff can carry nutrients away from the farm and into streams, rivers, and lakes. The EPA estimates that 58% of rivers and streams in the United States are high in nutrients. When waterways are too nutrient-dense algal blooms occur and deplete oxygen levels and block sunlight. Without adequate oxygen and sunlight other forms of aquatic life like fish suffer. This process is called Eutrophication. Nitrogen and Phosphorous are the primary nutrients that contribute to Eutrophication. In Mississippi, researchers found that runoff from urban gardens contained 2-3x as much dissolved nitrogen and 100x as much dissolved phosphorus as average urban runoff. However, that same study found that the amount of runoff from urban gardens was less than in areas without green space. In seas of cement, Urban Farms and gardens are sponges of porous soil that retain stormwater. The sponge effect of soil works in opposition to the increased nutrient densities of farming. We are interested in the effect of Urban Farming in the Boston area. Keeping in mind the two mentioned effects, we ask do Urban Farms contribute to higher nutrient densities in Boston waterways.
We are interested in urban farms in the Boston area. Our primary dataset will utilize the Water Quality laboratory data (2005-2020), a large dataset of water quality sample data including nutrients and other parameters collected at various monitoring stations throughout Massachusetts, from mass.gov. We will also be using information from GrowBoston to compile our own dataset on urban farm locations and other relevant information. The water quality dataset is quite large, with 78490 samples recorded. Though we will be going through and refining the data to only include samples relevant to urban farm locations in the Boston area, there should still be a significant number of samples to work with. We will identify and pair sensors close to Urban Farms in Boston and compare their data with the data of sensors further away.
